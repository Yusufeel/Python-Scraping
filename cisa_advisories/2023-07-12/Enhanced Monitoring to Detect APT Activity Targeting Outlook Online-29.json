The agency reported the activity to Microsoft and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Microsoft determined that advanced persistent threat (APT) actors accessed and exfiltrated unclassified Exchange Online Outlook data. CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide guidance to critical infrastructure organizations on enhancing monitoring of Microsoft Exchange Online environments. Organizations can enhance their cyber posture and position themselves to detect similar malicious activity by implementing logging recommendations in this advisory. Organizations that identify suspicious, anomalous activity should contact Microsoft for proceeding with mitigation actions due to the cloud-based infrastructure affected, as well as report to CISA and the FBI.

                    "data": "In Mid-June 2023, an FCEB agency observed MailItemsAccessed events with an unexpected ClientAppID and AppID in M365 Audit Logs. The MailItemsAccessed event is generated when licensed users access items in Exchange Online mailboxes using any connectivity protocol from any client. The FCEB agency deemed this activity suspicious because the observed AppId did not normally access mailbox items in their environment. The agency reported the activity to Microsoft and CISA. (Updated July 14, 2023) Microsoft determined that APT actors accessed and exfiltrated unclassified Exchange Online Outlook data from a small number of accounts. The APT actors used a Microsoft account (MSA) consumer key to forge tokens to impersonate consumer and enterprise users. Microsoft remediated the issue by first blocking tokens issued with the acquired key and then replacing the key to prevent continued misuse. Microsoft determined that this activity was part of a campaign targeting multiple organizations (all of which have been notified by Microsoft). [1] The affected FCEB agency identified suspicious activity by leveraging enhanced logging\u2014specifically of MailItemsAccessed events\u2014and an established baseline of normal Outlook activity (e.g., expected AppID). The MailItemsAccessed event enables detection of otherwise difficult to detect adversarial activity. CISA and FBI are not aware of other audit logs or events that would have detected this activity. Critical infrastructure organizations are strongly urged to implement the logging recommendations in this advisory to enhance their cybersecurity posture and position themselves to detect similar malicious activity."

Note: Per CISA s Microsoft Exchange Online Microsoft 365 Minimum Viable Secure Configuration Baselines, FCEB agencies shall enable audit logging. These minimum viable secure configuration baselines are part of CISA s Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) Project, which provides guidance for FCEB agencies securing their cloud business application environments and protecting federal information created, accessed, shared, and stored in those environments. Although tailored to FCEB agencies, the project provides security guidance applicable to all organizations with cloud environments. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) M-21-31 requires Microsoft audit logs be retained for at least twelve months in active storage and an additional eighteen months in cold storage. This can be accomplished either by offloading the logs out of the cloud environment or natively through Microsoft by creating an audit log retention policy. In addition to enabling audit logging, CISA and FBI strongly encourage organizations to:"
