                    "data": "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Norwegian National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NO) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to active exploitation of CVE-2023-35078 and CVE-2023-35081. Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploited CVE-2023-35078 as a zero day from at least April 2023 through July 2023 to gather information from several Norwegian organizations, as well as to gain access to and compromise a Norwegian government agency s network. Ivanti released a patch for CVE-2023-35078 on July 23, 2023. Ivanti later determined actors could use CVE-2023-35078 in conjunction with another vulnerability CVE-2023-35081 and released a patch for the second vulnerability on July 28, 2023. NCSC-NO observed possible vulnerability chaining of CVE-2023-35081 and CVE-2023-35078. CVE-2023-35078 is a critical vulnerability affecting Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) (formerly known as MobileIron Core). The vulnerability allows threat actors to access personally identifiable information (PII) and gain the ability to make configuration changes on compromised systems. CVE-2023-35081 enables actors with EPMM administrator privileges to write arbitrary files with the operating system privileges of the EPMM web application server. Threat actors can chain these vulnerabilities to gain initial, privileged access to EPMM systems and execute uploaded files, such as webshells. Mobile device management (MDM) systems are attractive targets for threat actors because they provide elevated access to thousands of mobile devices, and APT actors have exploited a previous MobileIron vulnerability. Consequently, CISA and NCSC-NO are concerned about the potential for widespread exploitation in government and private sector networks. This CSA provides indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) obtained by NCSC-NO investigations. The CSA also includes a nuclei template to identify unpatched devices and detection guidance organizations can use to hunt for compromise. CISA and NCSC-NO encourage organizations to hunt for malicious activity using the detection guidance in this CSA. If potential compromise is detected, organizations should apply the incident response recommendations included in this CSA. If no compromise is detected, organizations should still immediately apply patches released by Ivanti. Download the PDF version of this report:"

See the MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section of this advisory for a table of the threat actors activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. For assistance with mapping malicious cyber activity to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, see CISA and MITRE ATT&CK s Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK Mapping and CISA s Decider Tool. In July 2023, NCSC-NO became aware of APT actors exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Ivanti Endpoint Manager (EPMM), formerly known as MobileIron Core, to target a Norwegian government network. Ivanti confirmed that the threat actors exploited CVE-2023-35078 and released a patch on July 23, 2023.[1] Ivanti later determined actors could use CVE-2023-35078 in conjunction with another vulnerability, CVE-2023-35081, and released a patch for the second vulnerability on July 28, 2023.[2] CVE-2023-35078 is a critical authentication bypass [CWE-288] vulnerability affecting Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), formerly known as MobileIron Core. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated access to specific application programming interface (API) paths. Threat actors with access to these API paths can access PII such as names, phone numbers, and other mobile device details of users on the vulnerable system; make configuration changes to vulnerable systems; push new packages to mobile endpoints; and access Global Positioning System (GPS) data if enabled. According to Ivanti, CVE-2023-35078 can be chained with a second vulnerability CVE-2023-35081.[2] CVE-2023-35081 is directory traversal vulnerability [CWE-22] in EPMM. This vulnerability allows threat actors with EPMM administrator privileges the capability to write arbitrary files, such as webshells, with operating system privileges of the EPMM web application server. The actors can then execute the uploaded file.[2] CISA added CVE-2023-35078 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on July 25, 2023, and CVE-2023-35081 on July 31, 2023. CISA and NCSC-NO are concerned about the potential for widespread exploitation of both vulnerabilities in government and private sector networks because MDM systems provide elevated access to thousands of mobile devices. Threat actors, including APT actors, have previously exploited a MobileIron vulnerability [3],[4]. The APT actors have exploited CVE-2023-35078 since at least April 2023. The actors leveraged compromised small office/home office (SOHO) routers, including ASUS routers, to proxy [T1090] to target infrastructure, and NCSC-NO observed the actors exploiting CVE-2023-35078 to obtain initial access to EPMM devices [T1190] and:"

The actors deleted log entries with the string Firefox/107.0. The APT actors used Linux and Windows user agents with Firefox/107.0 to communicate with EPMM. Other agents were used; however, these user agents did not appear in the device logs. It is unconfirmed how the threat actors ran shell commands on the EPMM device; however, NCSC-NO suspects the actors exploited CVE-2023-35081 to upload webshells on the EPMM device and run commands [T1059]. The APT actors tunneled traffic [T1572] from the internet through Ivanti Sentry, an application gateway appliance that supports EPMM, to at least one Exchange server that was not accessible from the internet [T1090.001]. It is unknown how they tunneled traffic. NCSC-NO observed that the network traffic used the TLS certificate of the internal Exchange server. The APT actors likely installed webshells [T1505.003] on the Exchange server in the following paths [T1036.005]:"
