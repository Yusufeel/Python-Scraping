IDOR vulnerabilities are access control vulnerabilities enabling malicious actors to modify or delete data or access sensitive data by issuing requests to a website or a web application programming interface (API) specifying the user identifier of other, valid users. These requests succeed where there is a failure to perform adequate authentication and authorization checks. These vulnerabilities are frequently exploited by malicious actors in data breach incidents because they are common, hard to prevent outside the development process, and can be abused at scale. IDOR vulnerabilities have resulted in the compromise of personal, financial, and health information of millions of users and consumers. ACSC, CISA, and NSA strongly encourage vendors, designers, developers, and end-user organizations to implement the recommendations found within the Mitigations section of this advisory\u2014including the following\u2014to reduce prevalence of IDOR flaws and protect sensitive data in their systems."

Particular recommended practices are defined in the National Institute of Security and Technology\u2019s (NIST\u2019s) Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF), SP 800-218. Lend special attention to:\n\nConducting code reviews [SSDF PW 7.2, RV 1.2] against peer coding standards, checking for backdoors, malicious content, or logic flaws.\n\nACSC, CISA, and NSA recommend using automated code analysis tools for all supported releases to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.\n\n\nFollowing secure coding practices [SSDF PW 5.1] for web and mobile applications to ensure that they properly validate user input and generate strong user IDs.\n\nUse indirect reference maps, such that IDs, names, and keys are not exposed in URLs. Replace them with cryptographically strong, random values\u2014specifically use a UUID or a GUID. Note: UUIDs and GUIDs should not be used for security capabilities. See Request for Comment (RFC) 4122 for more information.\nConfigure applications to deny access by default and ensure the application performs authentication and authorization checks for every request to modify data, delete data, and access sensitive data. For example:\n\nNormalize requests. There are many ways to encode and decode web inputs. Decode and normalize inputs before creating access control checkpoints. Ensure the access control system and other parts of the web application perform the same normalization.\nImplement parameter verification leveraging syntactic and logical validation, such that web applications validate all inputs received with every HTTP/S request. Denying invalid requests can reduce the burden on the access control system.\n\nSyntactic validation verifies that for each input the incoming value meets your applications\u2019 expectations. When doing syntactic validation, verify that strings are within the minimum and maximum length required, strings do not contain unacceptable characters, numeric values are within the minimum and maximum boundaries, and the input is of the proper data type.\nLogical validation adds checks to see if the input values make sense and are consistent with design intent. When doing logical validation, verify authorization checks are performed in the correct locations, are of varying pedigree, and that there is error handling of failed authentication and authorization requests.\n\n\n\n\nUse CAPTCHA to limit automated invalid user requests where feasible.\nUse memory-safe programming languages where possible.\n\n\nTesting code to identify vulnerabilities and verify compliance with security requirements [SSDF PW 8.2].\nUse automated testing tools to facilitate testing, fuzz testing tools to find issues with input handling,[8] and penetration testing to simulate how a threat actor may exploit the software. Consider using dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools to identify IDOR vulnerabilities in web applications.\nConducting role-based training [SSDF PO 2.2] for personnel responsible for secure software development.\nExercising due diligence when selecting third-party libraries or frameworks to incorporate into your application [SSDF PW 4.1].\n\nReview and evaluate third-party components in the context of their expected use.\nVerify the integrity of the product through hash or signature verification.\nIf provided, review component\u2019s Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for outdated, vulnerable, or unauthorized applications before using it.\nKeep all third-party frameworks and dependencies up to date to limit vulnerability inheritance. Note: Organizations should maintain an inventory or catalog of third-party frameworks and dependencies to assist with proactive updates.
